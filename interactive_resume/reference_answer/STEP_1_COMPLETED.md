# Step 1 Reference: Completed Plan

This is how a finalized `plan.md` should look before you start prompting.

## Project Overview

I want to build a modern, interactive resume web page using React that displays my professional profile from a standard JSON format.

## 1. What are you trying to build?

A generic, customizable resume website that loads data from a local JSON file. It should have a clean, modern design.

## 2. What does done look like?

- A responsive website hosted locally.
- Sections for Basics, Work, Education, and Skills.
- "Dark Mode" styling by default.
- Navigation links to social profiles.

## 3. What technologies will you use?

- Vite + React for the framework.
- Standard CSS for detailed styling control.
- `lucide-react` for icons.
- JSON for the data source.

## Additional Requirements

- **No external heavy libraries** (like complex resume builders). We want to build it ourselves.
- **Animation**: Simple fade-ins for sections.
- **Clean Code**: Broken down into small components (`Header`, `Experience`, etc.).

## Specific Questions

- How do I structure the JSON data?
- What is the best way to map JSON arrays to React components?
- How do I set up global CSS variables for theming?
