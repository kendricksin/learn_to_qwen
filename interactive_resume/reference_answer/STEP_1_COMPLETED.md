## Project Overview:
I want to build a modern, interactive resume web page that displays my professional profile from a standard JSON format that I can edit easily.

## 1. What are you trying to build?
- Resume website designed for Clarity, Speed, and Professional Tone
- Easy to Verify and Connect with links to my other profile pages and contact information

## 2. What does 'done' look like?
- It Loads Fast and Works Everywhere
- Key Info Is Easy to Find (in <10 seconds)
- Looks Clean and Professional

## 3. What technologies will you use?
- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub Pages
- JSON resume

## Additional Requirements
- Customization: Have downloadable PDF format on click, allow light and dark mode
- Deployment: It should be easy to host on GitHub Pages and I can refresh it anytime

## Specific Questions
- Can you provide a sample `resume.json` based on the standard?

```
