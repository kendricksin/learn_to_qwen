# Step 1: Fill out your plan.md

A good plan is the foundation of a successful AI-assisted project. Before you start prompting, clarify your goals using the **3-Question Approach**:

1. **What are you trying to build?**
2. **What does 'done' look like?**
3. **What technology will you use?**

### Create Your `plan.md`

Create a file named `plan.md` in your project folder and use the following template:

```markdown
## Project Overview:
I want to build a modern, interactive resume web page using React that displays my professional profile from a standard JSON format.

## 1. What are you trying to build?
[Your specific requirements here]

## 2. What does 'done' look like?
[Your success criteria here]

## 3. What technologies will you use?
[Your technology stack here]

## Additional Requirements
- Customization: I want to be able to change the color palette easily.
- Interactivity: The resume should feel "alive" with hover effects.
- Deployment: It should be easy to host on GitHub Pages or Vercel.

## Specific Questions
- What's the best way to structure a Vite React project for a resume?
- How do I integrate the `@welovedevs/react-ultimate-resume` library?
- Can you provide a sample `resume.json` based on the standard?
- How can I add a personal touch to the theme?
```

### Pro-Tips

- Be specific about the visual style you want (e.g., "minimalist", "bold", "dark mode").
- Mention that you want to use the JSON Resume standard.
- Ask the AI to help you set up the initial React project structure.
