# Step 1: Fill out your plan.md

A good plan is the foundation of a successful AI-assisted project. Before you start prompting, clarify your goals using the **3-Question Approach**:

1. **What are you trying to build?** tip: Use AI to guide your product design. e.g. "How can I make my resume stand out?" "I want to showcase my personal projects in the frontpage" etc.
2. **What does 'done' look like?** tip: Put yourself in the user perspective reading your resume. Ask AI what makes a resume stand out.
3. **What technology will you use?**  tip: Ask AI for reccomended technologies and list the pros and cons e.g. "What tech stack fits my purpose? List the pros and cons of using that technology"

### Create Your `plan.md`

Create a file named `plan.md` in your project folder and use the following template:

```markdown
## Project Overview:
I want to build a modern, interactive resume web page using React that displays my professional profile from a standard JSON format that I can edit easily.

## 1. What are you trying to build?
[Your specific requirements here]

## 2. What does 'done' look like?
[Your success criteria here]

## 3. What technologies will you use?
[Your technology stack here]

## Additional Requirements
- Customization: I want to be able to change the color palette easily. I want to be able to update my resume easily.
- Interactivity: The resume should feel responsive, reacting to users mouse hovers and link to detailed tabs of each section.
- Deployment: It should be easy to host on GitHub Pages.

## Specific Questions
- What's the best way to structure a Vite React project for a resume?
- How do I integrate the `@welovedevs/react-ultimate-resume` library?
- Can you provide a sample `resume.json` based on the standard?
- How can I add a personal touch to the theme?
```

### Pro-Tips

- Be specific about the visual style you want (e.g., "minimalist", "bold", "dark mode").
- Mention that you want to use the JSON Resume standard.
- Ask the AI to help you set up the initial React project structure.
