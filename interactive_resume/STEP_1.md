# Step 1: Fill out your plan.md

A good plan is the foundation of a successful AI-assisted project. Before you start prompting, clarify your goals using the **3-Question Approach**.

Use AI to help you answer each question:

### Question 1: What are you trying to build?

Ask the AI to help you define your goals:
> *"I want to build a resume website. What features should I include to make it stand out?"*

**Key considerations:**
- Clarity, Speed, and Professional Tone
- Easy to verify and connect (links to profiles, contact info)
- What makes a resume memorable?

### Question 2: What does 'done' look like?

Put yourself in the recruiter's perspective:
> *"What makes a resume website effective? What should a recruiter see in the first 10 seconds?"*

**Success criteria:**
- Loads fast and works everywhere
- Key info is easy to find (< 10 seconds)
- Looks clean and professional

### Question 3: What technologies will you use?

Ask AI for recommendations:
> *"What tech stack should I use for a simple resume website that's easy to deploy? List pros and cons."*

**Consider:**
- HTML/CSS vs React vs other frameworks
- GitHub Pages for free hosting
- JSON Resume standard for data
