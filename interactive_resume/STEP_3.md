# Step 3: Iterate on the Conversation

Building a web app is rarely a "one-shot" process. You'll need to refine the design and handle more complex parts.

### Handling Complexity

Once you have a basic page running, start adding more features or refining the look.

**Example Refinement Prompts:**

- *"How can I change the primary color of the resume to a nice emerald green?"*
- *"I want to add a 'Projects' section that shows images of my work. How do I update my `resume.json` and the React code?"*
- *"Can we add a smooth fade-in animation when the page loads?"*

### Debugging & Learning

If you run into an error (which is normal!), just copy and paste it back to the AI.

**Prompting for Errors:**
> "I'm getting this error in my terminal: `[Paste error here]`. What does this mean and how can I fix it?"

### Pro-Tips

- Ask the AI to explain *why* it's suggesting a certain change.
- Keep your commits small and frequent. "Got the basic layout working" → Commit!
