# Step 2: Paste it into Qwen Chat

Now that you have a plan, it's time to start collaborating with the AI.

### Preparing the Prompt

Copy the contents of your `plan.md` and use it as your first prompt. You can add a friendly introduction to set the context.

**Example Starting Prompt:**
> "Hi Qwen! I'm a beginner wanting to build an interactive resume. Here is my project plan: [Paste your plan.md content here]. Can you help me get started with the project structure and the first steps?"

### What to Expect

- Qwen will suggest a folder structure (likely using Vite and React).
- It will give you the commands to install the necessary libraries, including `@welovedevs/react-ultimate-resume`.
- It might provide a basic `App.jsx` to get things running.

### Pro-Tips

- If the AI gives you a lot of code at once, ask it to break it down.
- Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet—you're just setting up the foundation!
