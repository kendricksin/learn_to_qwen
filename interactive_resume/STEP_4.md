# Step 4: Build the Project

You're almost there! In this final step, you'll polish your resume and prepare it for the world to see.

### Final Checks

- Does the resume look good on your mobile phone? (Use browser dev tools to check).
- Is all your professional information up to date in `resume.json`?
- Did you remove any placeholder text?

### Building for Production

When you're ready to share your resume, you need to "build" the project into a set of static files.

**Terminal Command:**

```bash
npm run build
```

The AI can guide you on how to deploy these files to platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for free!

### Congratulations! 🚀

You've just built an interactive, modern resume using AI assistance. You're now a "Vibe Coder"!
