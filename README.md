# AI Coding Workflow (Qwen)
*A beginner-friendly guide, with minimal setup to start coding with AI assistance*

> **What is "vibe coding"?**  
> It’s a relaxed, iterative way of building software with the help of AI. Instead of writing everything yourself, you *collaborate* with an AI like Qwen Code to brainstorm, draft, debug, and refine your code—while you stay in control!

This tutorial walks you through the full beginner workflow using tools like **VS Code**, **Qwen Code**, **Python**, **npm**, and **Git**. You’ll go from zero to sharing your first AI-assisted project on GitHub!

## ✅ Step 1: Download and Install the Tools

### 1. Install **VS Code** (or any IDE)
- Go to [VS Code Homepage](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download for your OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Run the installer (keep defaults)
- Start VS Code (this is our core tool)

<img width="742" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15083683-5a6d-449b-9786-3df1c1472e86" />


### 2. Install **Python**
- Go to [Python Homepage](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the latest version
- ✅ **Important**: Check “Add Python to PATH” during install!
- Python is a intepreter for the coding language, we dont have to "start a program"


<img width="950" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96290e7-58a1-4f70-9cd4-705eac5dc656" />


### 3. Install **Node.js** (includes **npm**)
- Go to [Node.js Homepage](https://nodejs.org/)
- Download the **LTS** version (recommended for beginners)
- Run the installer
- Node.js is a runtime environment, and JIT compiler, we also do not technically run any exe file.

> After installing, open VSC Terminal (Bash) and type the following:
> ```bash
> python --version
> npm --version
> git --version
> ```
> If these return version numbers, you’re good!

### 4 (Optional). Get **Qwen Code**
- Option A: Use Qwen via web at [Qwen Chat](chat.qwen.ai)
  - You can copy-paste code between browser and VS Code
- Option B: Use **Qwen Code** (official Qwen Code extension)
  - Visit the official Qwen Code github repo for more details https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code

## 📁 Step 1a: Set Up Your Working Folder

1. Open **File Explorer** ([Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/file-explorer-in-windows-ef370130-1cca-9dc5-e0df-2f7416fe1cb1)) or **Finder** ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/mac-help/mchlp2605/mac))
2. Go to your **Documents** folder
3. Create a new folder called `my-first-ai-project`
4. In VS Code: `File → Open Folder` → Select this folder

You now have a clean workspace! Everything you build will live here.

## 👀 Step 1b (Optional): Get Comfortable with VS Code & Qwen Code

### In VS Code:
- **Explorer** (left sidebar): Your files and folders
- **Editor** (center): Where you write code
- **Terminal** (bottom): Type commands like `python your_script.py`
  - Open it with `Ctrl + `` ` (backtick) or `View → Terminal`
<img width="744" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d959832-2588-4a33-bc9a-414927eb3afa" />

### Using Qwen Code (via https://chat.qwen.ai/):
1. Highlight a piece of code or place your cursor where you want help
2. Press `Ctrl + L` (or right-click → “Ask Qwen”)
3. Type a prompt like:
   - “Explain this code”
   - “How do I read a file in Python?”
   - “Fix this error: …”

---

## 🎯 Step 2: Plan Your Project (“Architecting & Engineering”)

Before writing code, ask yourself:

### 🔍 What are you trying to build?
- Example: *“Make a batch emailer script that when run will send emails to my list of clients.”*
- Or try one of these sample projects:
  - **[Batch Emailer](./batch_emailer/README.md)** - STATUS: In Progress
  - **[Interactive Resume Page](./interactive_resume/README.md)** - STATUS: TBC
  - **[POS Data Analyzer](./pos_data_analyzer/README.md)** - STATUS: TBC

### ✅ What does “done” look like? (Define success)
- It runs without errors
- It reads my input files and sends emails with my selected template
- I can send it to any email including my friends email

### ⚙️ What technologies will you use?
- Language: **Python** (simple and readable)
- No external libraries needed (keep it beginner-friendly)
- Git for version control

> 💡 **AI Tip**: Treat Qwen like a senior dev teammate—be clear, specific, and polite!
> 🧠 **Learning**: Ask AI what are the technologies availabe to choose and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.

### 📚 Sample Projects to Try
Here are some sample projects you can create using vibe coding to practice your skills:

- **[Batch Emailer](./batch_emailer/README.md)**: Learn about SMTP protocols and securing passwords with environment variables while creating a tool to send batch emails with HTML templates
- **[Interactive Resume Page](./interactive_resume/README.md)**: Build a dynamic resume web page using Node.js, npm packages, and Markdown parsing
- **[POS Data Analyzer](./pos_data_analyzer/README.md)**: Create a data visualization app to analyze Point of Sale data using Streamlit and SQLite3

---

## 🔄 Step 3: The “Prompt → Test → Commit” Cycle

This is your core workflow. Repeat as needed!

### 1. **Prompt** (Ask Qwen for help)
- Example prompt:  
  *“Write a python scripts that uses SMTP to send my email template to my friends email using my email.”*
- Paste Qwen’s response into a new file in VS Code: `email_script.py`

### 2. **Test** (Run and check)
- In VS Code Terminal:
  ```bash
  python email_script.py
  ```
- Try it! Does it work? If not:
  - Read the error
  - Copy it into Qwen: *“Why am I getting this error: …?”*

### 3. **Commit** (Save your progress with Git)
Every time you finish a small working version:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "I added a new button"
```

> ✅ Each commit is a safe checkpoint. You can always go back!
> 🧠 **Learning**: Ask any AI Chatbot what Git is and "how to use Git like a pro"!

## 🌐 Share Your Work on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) → Sign up (free)
2. Click **+ → New repository**
   - Name: `my-first-ai-project`
   - ✅ **Initialize with a README** (optional but helpful)
   - Click **Create**
3. Back in your VS Code terminal:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-first-ai-project.git

   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Visit your GitHub repo in the browser—you’ll see your code online!

> 🎉 Now you can share the link with friends or your future self!

## 🧘 Final Tips for Vibe Coding Success

- **Start tiny**: Build a 5-line script before a full app
- **Embrace errors**: They’re clues, not failures
- **Ask Qwen to explain**, not just give answers
- **Commit often**: “It works!” → commit. “Added color” → commit.
- **Have fun**: Coding + AI = creative superpower
