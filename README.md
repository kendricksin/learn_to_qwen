A comprehensive guide to using AI for coding - from beginner to advanced

## Introduction to AI-Assisted Development

This repository provides a structured approach to learning how to use AI tools for coding. Rather than focusing on a single tutorial, we provide multiple example projects that demonstrate different aspects of AI-assisted development.

## Getting Started with AI Coding

AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and others can significantly accelerate your development process. Here's how to get started:

### Basic Tools Required

1. **Python 3.x** - Most examples will use Python as it's beginner-friendly
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Verify installation: `python --version` or `python3 --version`

2. **A Code Editor** - Choose one that supports AI integration:
   - VS Code (recommended) with extensions like GitHub Copilot
   - JetBrains IDEs with AI plugins
   - Vim/Neovim with AI plugins
   - Any editor with AI integration

3. **Command Line Interface** - Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt/Powershell (Windows)

4. **Git** - For version control
   - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

### Essential AI Coding Skills

1. **Clear Prompting** - Learn to describe what you want in precise terms
2. **Code Review** - Always review AI-generated code for correctness and security
3. **Iterative Development** - Use AI to build features incrementally
4. **Debugging** - Understand how to troubleshoot AI-generated code

## Project Examples

This repository is organized with the main concepts in the root, and specific example projects in subdirectories:

### Available Examples

- **[customer_registration_app](./customer_registration_app/)** - A Python application with SQLite database for managing customer information
- More examples coming soon...

### How to Use These Examples

1. Navigate to the example directory: `cd example_name`
2. Read the README in that directory for specific instructions
3. Follow the step-by-step tutorial
4. Modify the code to experiment and learn

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Always Verify Code** - AI can generate code that looks correct but has subtle bugs
2. **Understand What You're Building** - Don't just copy-paste; understand the logic
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Verify that AI-generated code works as expected
4. **Learn the Fundamentals** - AI tools are aids, not replacements for understanding programming concepts
5. **Document Your Process** - Keep notes on what worked and what didn't

## Contributing

This is an evolving resource. If you have suggestions for improvements or additional examples, feel free to contribute!

## Next Steps

1. Explore the example projects in the subdirectories
2. Practice with simple coding tasks first
3. Gradually work on more complex projects
4. Join coding communities to share experiences and learn from others
