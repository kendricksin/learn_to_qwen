# Step 2: Paste it into Qwen Chat

Now that you have your `plan.md` ready, it's time to start the conversation with the AI.

### Action Checklist:
1. **Open your AI chat interface** (e.g., Qwen).
2. **Copy the entire content** of your `plan.md`.
3. **Draft a simple opening prompt** like:
   > "I am working on a batch emailer project. Here is my plan. Please review it and suggest the next steps and project structure."
4. **Paste the plan** after your prompt and hit send.

### What to expect:
The AI should respond with a suggested folder structure, a list of libraries to install (likely `yagmail` or Python's built-in `smtplib`), and potentially a starter script.
