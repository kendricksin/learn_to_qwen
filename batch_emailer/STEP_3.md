# Step 3: Iterate on the Conversation

Coding is an iterative process. Rarely will the first script be perfect.

### How to Iterate:
- **Clarify logic**: If the AI suggests a structure you don't like, ask for alternatives. For example: *"Can we use HTML files for templates instead of strings in the script?"*
- **Handle Errors**: If you run the code and get an error, **copy and paste the entire error message** back to the AI.
- **Ask "Why?"**: If you don't understand a line of code, ask: *"Can you explain how the environment variable part works?"*

### Sample Prompts to Try:
- *"How can I structure my folder for this project?"*
- *"How can I make interactive design templates for my email?"*
- *"What alternatives do I have to a Python script?"*
