# Step 1: Fill out your plan.md

A good plan is the foundation of a successful AI-assisted project. Before you start prompting, clarify your goals using the **3-Question Approach**:

1. **What are you trying to build?**
2. **What does 'done' look like?**
3. **What technology will you use?**

### Create Your `plan.md`
Create a file named `plan.md` in your project folder and use the following template:

```markdown
## Project Overview:
I want to build a batch emailer that sends personalized template emails to multiple recipients.

## 1. What are you trying to build?
[Your specific requirements here]

## 2. What does done look like?
[Your success criteria here]

## 3. What technologies will you use?
[Your technology stack here]

## Additional Requirements
- Security: Use environment variables for email credentials
- Personalization: Include recipient names in emails, and custom email template
- File structure: Organize code in a clean project structure

## Specific Questions
- What Python libraries do you recommend for this project?
- How should I structure the project files?
- What's the best way to handle email templates?
- How can I ensure email credentials are secure?
```

### Pro-Tips:
- Be specific about constraints.
- Mention security (like environment variables) early.
- Ask the AI to explain complex parts.
