# Batch Emailer Project - AI Prompting Guide

Learn how to effectively prompt AI to help you build a batch emailer using Python's SMTP protocol with HTML templates and environment variable security.

## The 3-Question Approach for AI Prompting

1. **What are you trying to build?** - *In this project we will build a emailer to send to a mail list.*
2. **What does 'done' look like?** - *In a emailer project success means after we run the script, it would send emails to our mail list.*
3. **What technology will you use?** - *For a beginner, we may not know, so we can ask AI to suggest us, but we have a baseline ready with VSC and python.*

## Creating Your plan.md File

Create a `plan.md` file with the following template and paste it into your AI prompt:

```
## Project Overview:
I want to build a batch emailer that sends personalized template emails to multiple recipients.

## 1. What are you trying to build?
[Your specific requirements here]

## Additional Requirements
- Security: Use environment variables for email credentials
- Personalization: Include recipient names in emails, and custom email template
- File structure: Organize code in a clean project structure

## Specific Questions
- What Python libraries do you recommend for this project?
- How should I structure the project files?

## Tips for Better AI Responses

- Be specific about your requirements and constraints
- Mention any libraries or frameworks you want to use
- Include error handling and security requirements
- Ask for code examples and best practices
- Request explanations for complex concepts
- Clarify any parts of the response you don't understand

## Sample Prompts to Try

1. "How can i structure my folder for this project?"

2. "What alternatives do I have to python script?"

3. "How can i make interactive design templates for my email?"

## Next Steps

1. Fill out your `plan.md` file with your specific requirements
2. Paste it into an Qwen chat, with a basic prompt
3. Iterate on the conversation to refine your approach, copy and paste any errors you find.
4. Use the AI's suggestions to build your batch emailer
